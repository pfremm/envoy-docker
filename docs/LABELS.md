# Envoy label reference

This control plane reads routing intent from two places: Docker container
labels and an optional static YAML file. This document is the reference for
both.

## Docker labels

A container is only considered for routing when it opts in:

| Label | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `envoy.enable` | yes | Set to `"true"` to include the container. Any other value (or absence) means the container is ignored entirely. |

Each router is a group of labels sharing the prefix
`envoy.http.routers.<name>.`, where `<name>` is an arbitrary router
identifier (e.g. `web`, `admin`, `api`). A single container may define any
number of routers.

### Per-router fields

| Label | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `envoy.http.routers.<name>.subdomain` | yes | The subdomain this router serves. The legacy (no-rule) virtual host is named `<subdomain>.<baseDomain>`. |
| `envoy.http.routers.<name>.port` | yes | The backend port, an integer `1-65535`. |
| `envoy.http.routers.<name>.network` | no | The Docker network to resolve the container's IP on. When omitted, the `DOCKER_NETWORK` environment variable is used. If neither is set the router is skipped with a warning. |
| `envoy.http.routers.<name>.rule` | no | A routing rule in the rule DSL (below). When absent the router is a legacy catch-all for its subdomain. |
| `envoy.http.routers.<name>.priority` | no | An explicit integer priority that overrides rule-specificity ordering. See [Precedence](#precedence). |

Any other `envoy.http.routers.<name>.*` field is ignored.

### Validation and failure isolation

Validation happens per router, so one broken router never takes down the
rest of a container's routers:

- A router with an invalid `port` (non-integer or out of range) or an
  invalid `priority` (non-integer) is rejected **on its own**, with an
  actionable warning naming the field and the offending value. Sibling
  routers are unaffected.
- A router missing its `subdomain` or `port` is rejected on its own.
- A label that cannot be attributed to a single router (e.g. an empty
  router name) is a structural error and causes the whole container to be
  skipped.

### Example

```yaml
labels:
  envoy.enable: "true"
  # Legacy router: serves myapp.example.com, catch-all prefix.
  envoy.http.routers.web.subdomain: myapp
  envoy.http.routers.web.port: "8080"
  # Rule-based router on the same container, higher priority.
  envoy.http.routers.api.subdomain: myapp
  envoy.http.routers.api.port: "8081"
  envoy.http.routers.api.rule: "Host(myapp.example.com) && PathPrefix(/api) && Method(GET)"
  envoy.http.routers.api.priority: "10"
```

## The rule DSL

A rule is a boolean expression over matcher atoms.

### Grammar

```
expr    := term ( '||' term )*
term    := factor ( '&&' factor )*
factor  := '!' factor | '(' expr ')' | matcher
matcher := Host | Path | PathPrefix | Headers | Method | Query | ClientIP
```

- `&&` binds tighter than `||`.
- `!` is unary negation.
- Parentheses group sub-expressions.
- Multiple values inside a single matcher are ORed together.

### Matchers

| Matcher | Form | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Host` | `Host(a.com, b.com)` | The request `Host` header equals one of the listed hosts. |
| `Path` | `Path(/api, /v1)` | The request path equals one of the listed paths. |
| `PathPrefix` | `PathPrefix(/api, /admin)` | The request path starts with one of the listed prefixes. |
| `Headers` | `Headers(name, value, ...)` | Pairs of header name/value; each listed pair must match. |
| `Method` | `Method(GET, POST)` | The HTTP method equals one of the listed methods. |
| `Query` | `Query(name)` or `Query(name, value)` | Presence of a query parameter, or exact match of a parameter value. |
| `ClientIP` | `ClientIP(10.0.0.0/8, 192.168.1.1)` | The client source IP is in one of the listed CIDRs. |

### Translatability

`ClientIP` and negation on non-header matchers cannot be expressed as an
Envoy route match. When a rule uses them, that specific route is **skipped
with an actionable warning** (naming the matcher and the rule); the rest of
the host's routes are unaffected.

## Precedence

Within one virtual host, Envoy evaluates routes top-to-bottom and the first
match wins. The control plane orders routes with a deterministic precedence
(`model.SortByPrecedence`):

1. **Explicit priority** — a router with a `priority` label sorts before
   one without, and a higher value sorts before a lower one.
2. **Rule specificity** — a longer (more specific) rule expression sorts
   before a shorter one, so a narrow rule is not shadowed by a broad
   `PathPrefix(/)`.
3. **Router name** — a stable alphabetical tie-breaker.

A rule-based route is served by the virtual host of its rule's first
`Host(...)` atom. A legacy (no-rule) route keeps its own
`<subdomain>.<baseDomain>` virtual host. When any rule-based route exists,
legacy routes are additionally carried in a catch-all virtual host with
domain `*` so a request that matches no rule-based host still reaches them.
With no rule-based routes at all, the configuration is exactly the legacy
shape (one virtual host per subdomain, no catch-all).

## Static YAML config

For non-Docker backends, routes can be declared in a YAML file (path from
the `STATIC_CONFIG` environment variable; empty means none). On a
subdomain collision, a static route wins over a Docker-discovered one.

```yaml
routers:
  - subdomain: external
    port: 443
    addresses:
      - 203.0.113.10
      - 203.0.113.11
```

Each entry requires a `subdomain`, a `port`, and at least one `addresses`
entry. Duplicate subdomains within the file are an error.
